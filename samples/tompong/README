1. PREAMBLE
------------
Hullo, welcome to TomPong, I'm surprised you downloaded this! TomPong is an educational 
exercise for myself. In the future I hope to turn it into a tutorial for those wanting to 
learn how to write games with Python and Pygame.

It's released under the GNU General Public License (see enclosed LICENSE file), so you're 
free to copy, modify and redistribute it :)



2. INSTALLATION:
----------------
Ensure you have Python (>= 2.2) and Pygame (>= 1.5.3) installed. Unpack the files to some 
random directory, and you're done. Just run like so:
hostname$ python pong.py

OR

hostname$ chmod +x pong.py
hostname$ ./pong.py



3. HOW TO USE:
--------------
Controls:
     space bar - release ball to start playing
     a & z - up and down, player 1
     up_arrow & down_arrow - up and down, player 2
     p - pause
     f - toggle fullscreen 


Command-line options:
     -f - start in fullscreen mode
     -d - start in debug mode (good to find bugs/watch how it works)
     -s=x - make ball speed equal to x
     -ai=x - have computer control second player, with skill equal to x (0-10, where 10 is 
      best)

Enjoy!



4. PYGAME TUTORIAL
------------------
I have written a tutorial for making games with Pygame, that goes with TomPong. In fact, 
the tutorial shows you have to make Pong yourself. Find the tutorial at:
